Terraform allows us to create reusable code that can deploy identical set of infrastructure in a repetable fashion.

IaC mainly divided in 2 categories;
1. Infrastructure orchestration ( AWS cloudformation, Terraform )
2. Configuration Management (Ansible, chef,puppet etc)

CM tools are mainly used to maintain the desired configuration of the system(Inside Server)
Infrastructure Orchestration is primary used for creating and managing infrastructure environment

Authentication is the process of verifying who the user is
Authorizatoin is the the process of verifying what they have access to.

Terraform needs access credentials with relevant permissions to create and manage the environment

EC2- Instance type is a combination of CPU and Memory.

Terraform supports multiple provides- AWS, azure, gcp, ali baba etc

A provider is a plugin that lets terraform manage a external API.
When running terraform init, plugins required for the providers are automatically downloaded and stored in .terrform directory.
Whenever you define new provider , you have run the terraform init command

Resource block describes one or more infrastructure object related to provider

Terraform requires explicit source information for any providers that are not harsicorp certified, using a new syntax in the required_providers nested block inside the terraform configuration block.
